It was my first ML project. It is simple and clean. For a beginner it is very helpful for understanding the concepts of collection of data and how the training of model works.

Trained the classic Iris dataset from OpenML using a Random Forest Classifier in Jupyter Notebook, with an 80/20 train-test split to validate on unseen data.

This mini project was a quick refresher on data loading, splitting, model training, and evaluation, using a beginner-friendly dataset of 150 samples across three iris species and four numeric features.

Next steps: add accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report to benchmark performance and iterate on metrics and hyperparameters.

 Computed accuracy by iterating over test labels and comparing with model predictions, then calculating accuracy = (count of matches / total) Ã— 100.
 Achieved 97.06% accuracy.
